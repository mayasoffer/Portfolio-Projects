# Portfolio-Projects
## This Portfolio Consists of 3 Projects:  
1. [**Web-scraping Movies Data Project**](https://github.com/mayasoffer/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Movies%20data%20scraping%20project.ipynb) - Python 3:  
In this project, my goal was to scrape data about movies from the the-numbers.com website. The project is composed of a few key steps:  
- Using Web-scraping to scrape data from every movie page individually and saving it locally.
- Parsing the data and uploading it into a Data Frame, creating a Data-set.
2. [**Northwind DB Analysis Project**](https://github.com/mayasoffer/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Northwind%20analysis%20Project.sql) - SQL:  
Answering abstract business questions (Calculating customer satisfaction, RFM model, etc.) using SQL.
3. [**Video Games Analysis Project**](https://github.com/mayasoffer/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Video%20games%20analysis%20project.sql) - SQL:
