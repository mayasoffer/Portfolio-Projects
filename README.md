## This Portfolio Consists of 3 Projects:  
1. [**Web-scraping Movies data project**](https://github.com/mayasoffer/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Movies%20data%20scraping%20project.ipynb) - Python 3:  
In this project, my goal was to scrape data about movies from ["The-numbers"](https://www.the-numbers.com/) website.  
The project is composed of a few key steps:  
    - Using Web-scraping to scrape data from every movie page individually and saving it locally.
    - Parsing the data and uploading it into a Data Frame, creating a Data-set.
2. [**"How I Met Your Mother" script EDA project**](https://github.com/mayasoffer/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/How%20I%20Met%20Your%20Mother%20script%20analysis%20project.ipynb) - Python 3:  
 Analysing the HIMYM TV show data-set, and answering questions like:  
    - Who is the most mentioned character?  
    - Who mentions whom the most?  
    - Is the script transcribed properly? How can I prove that?
3. [**Northwind DB analysis project**](https://github.com/mayasoffer/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Northwind%20analysis%20Project.sql) - SQL:

4. [**Video Games analysis project**](https://github.com/mayasoffer/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Video%20games%20analysis%20project.sql) - SQL:
