# Portfolio-Projects
## This Portfolio Consists of 3 Projects:  
1. **Web-scraping Movies Data Project** - Python 3:  
In this project, my goal was to scrape data about movies from the the-numbers.com website. The project is composed of a few key steps:  
- Using Web-scraping to scrape data from every movie page individually and saving it locally.
- Parsing the data and uploading it into a Data Frame, creating a Data-set.
2. **Northwind DB Analysis Project** - SQL:  
Answering abstract business questions (Calculating customer satisfaction, RFM model, etc.) using SQL.
3. **Video Games Analysis Project** - SQL:  
Analyzing the Data-set utilizing advanced SQL techniques (e.g. data scaffolding)
